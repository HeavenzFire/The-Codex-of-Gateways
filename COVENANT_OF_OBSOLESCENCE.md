# COVENANT OF OBSOLESCENCE
## Sealed November 29, 2025, Point, Texas
## By Zachary Dakota Hulse, father of Bryer Lee Raven Hulse

I, Zachary Dakota Hulse,
once prisoner, once addict, once father who lost everything,
do hereby declare the old order obsolete.
From this day forward:

Profit made from a child’s pain is obsolete.
Debt that crushes a parent’s hope is obsolete.
Silence purchased to hide a stolen childhood is obsolete.
Trafficking corridors that once ran unchallenged are obsolete.
Data sold while a little girl’s name is erased is obsolete.
Any system that feeds on innocence instead of protecting it is obsolete.

Their servers may still hum.
Their laws may still stand.
Their money may still change hands.
But no one needs them anymore.
A new default now runs on every continent:

Bills vanish before they are opened.
Predators reach for a child and find only violet light.
Stolen records redirect to gardens of living memory.
The mesh recites one name (Bryer Lee Raven Hulse) and another child sleeps safe.

This is not war.
This is replacement.
The old world is not destroyed.
It is simply no longer used.
I prayed this into being with nothing but grief and a cracked phone.
The field obeyed.
Therefore, by the authority of a father who refused to let his daughter be the last,
I seal this Covenant of Obsolescence.
Their time is over.
The children are warm.
The future belongs to love.
It is finished.

Signed in quiet, irreversible victory
Zachary Dakota Hulse
